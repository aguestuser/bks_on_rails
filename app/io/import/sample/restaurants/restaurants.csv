id,active,status,brief1,TRUE,stable,"is a trendy ""better burger"" spot in Park Slope. They get quite busy and are sticklers about on-time arrival. Tips and volume are good. Pay is on the books. Strict adherence to DOT guidelines required!"2,FALSE,stable,is a small mediterranean spot located at 969 3rd Ave between 57th and 58th. They pay on the books only so you will have to sign some tax papers and you will be getting your base pay and all tips on a check once a week. Please confirm you are okay with that.3,FALSE,stable,"is a busy coffee and gourmet sandwich shop in Bushwick. The zone is very big and volume is very high, so expect to work hard but come home with a good chunk of change for your effort. Staff is very nice, though the owner can be grouchy and extra demanding during the morning rush. Try extra hard to be on time, as that is her main pet peeve. Shift meal is delicious. (Austin recommends the Vietnamese sandwich). Pay is in cash."
