<strong>CHECK-IN POLICY</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>To ensure our riders arrive on time and do not unexpectedly no-show, we have instituted the following check-in policy:</p>
<p>Please text347-640-64842 hours* prior to your shift's start time to let us know you will be there on time. If we don't hear from you after 1.5 hours, we will text you. If we still haven't heard from you 1 hour before your shift is scheduled to start, we will assume you are not working and will fill it with someone else. Even if you do show up, preference will be given to the emergency rider.</p>
<p>*= for shifts that start earlier than 9a, please text your confirmation before going to bed the night before</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>WEEKLY SCHEDULE</strong>

<br>
<strong>Thursday afternoon:</strong>You

<strong>IMPORTANT, PLEASE REVIEW: DOT REQUIREMENTS</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>This is useful information. Also information that can help you get more work. Some of our busy restaurants require that you follow the following DOT rules in order to get shifts with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your safety, and for the safety of others, please review Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DOT has recently passed relevant legislature that directly relates to your work. To put it simply they require you to do the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Ride with a helmet</p>
<p>2) Ride with a front white light</p>
<p>3) Ride with a back red light</p>
<p>4) Have a bell/whistle</p>
<p>5) Ride with a reflective vest (should be provided by the restaurant).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though technically they require that the restaurants provide you with this equipment, you must supply it yourself working with BK Shift (some restaurants may provide it for you already).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please review the online course at:</p>
