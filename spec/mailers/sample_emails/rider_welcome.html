<strong>CHECK-IN POLICY</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>To ensure our riders arrive on time and do not unexpectedly no-show, we have instituted the following check-in policy:</p>
<p>
Please text 347-460-6484 2 hours* prior to your shift's start time to let us know you will be there on time. If we don't hear from you after 1.5 hours, we will text you. If we still haven't heard from you 1 hour before your shift is scheduled to start,
<strong>we will assume you are not working and will fill it with someone else.</strong>
This will be counted as a no-show. Even if you do show up, preference will be given to the emergency rider.
</p>

<p>
<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>
<strong>POINT SYSTEM</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>BK Shift assigns its riders to restaurants based on the riders' performance. Your preferences as far as where you want to work is more likely to be taken into consideration if you are doing a good job!</p>
<p>You will receive better shifts if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are generally reliable and communicate well with BK Shift (check-in on time, confirm your schedule on time, show up to your shifts on time).</li>
<li>Get complimented or specially requested by restaurants.</li>
<li>Take emergency shifts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your shifts may not be as good if you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show up late to your shifts (if you are going to be late, please notify with an accurate ETA).</li>
<li>Get complaints from or banned by restaurants.</li>
<li>Call out of your confirmed shifts (if you call out within 36 hours of your shift's start time, you may be placed on Emergency Only status effective immediately).</li>
<li>No-show OR don't check in for your shift.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>
<span style='text-decoration: underline;'>
<strong>IMPORTANT, PLEASE REVIEW: DOT REQUIREMENTS</strong>
</span>
</p>
<p>This is useful information. Also information that can help you get more work. Some of our busy restaurants require that you follow the following DOT rules in order to get shifts with them.</p>
<p>For your safety, and for the safety of others, please review Department of Transportation (DOT) requirements below:</p>
<p>DOT has recently passed relevant legislature that directly relates to your work. To put it simply they require you to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ride with a helmet</li>
<li>Ride with a front white light</li>
<li>Ride with a back red light</li>
<li>Have a bell/whistle</li>
<li>Ride with a reflective vest (should be provided by the restaurant).</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Even though technically they require that the restaurants provide you with this equipment,
<strong>you must supply it yourself working with BK Shift</strong>
(some restaurants may provide it for you already).
